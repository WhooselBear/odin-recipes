            <p>The industrial revolution radically changed the  lives of those in the workforce. Before working their long shifts at the factory, workers had to have a quick and easy breakfast that would get them through their hours of toil.In the 1800’s, British street vendors began selling “bap” sandwiches to these crowds, consisting of egg and meat on a soft roll—the predecessor of the bacon, egg, and cheese! As factories popped up on this side of the ocean, this breakfast creation came onto the scene.</p>

            <p>Not long after its first debut in a recipe book in 1897, this pile of bacon, egg, and bread entered the cheese dimension. We thank the heavens for this revelation! As society became convenience-obsessed in the 1950’s, its popularity snowballed, spawning local variations like the Denver sandwich (you’re probably familiar with this combo in omelet form), the biscuit-based version of the south, or the deli-ified bagel B.E.C. Not to mention the “upgraded” versions featuring croissants, brie, serrano, etc…</p>
            <p>While we love fancy, humbleness is a key part of a B.E.C. That being said, we didn’t say low-quality, so please don’t mention McDonald’s here. The bacon, egg, and cheese breakfast sammy has long been enjoyed in corner stores and bodegas across the country, and continues to keep America running in the morning. It was created with a working-class mission in mind: to provide energy and to counteract hangovers.</p>
